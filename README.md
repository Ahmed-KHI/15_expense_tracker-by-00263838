Expense Tracker Project 

Description: The Expense Tracker is a robust application designed to help users efficiently manage and track their daily expenses. This project serves as a practical tool for monitoring spending habits and maintaining financial awareness.

Functionalities:

Add Expense: Users can input new expenses with details such as name, amount, and date.

Edit Expense: Existing expenses can be modified, allowing for accurate tracking of changes.

Delete Expense: Users have the option to remove any unwanted expense entries.

Display Total Expenses: The application automatically calculates and displays the total amount spent, providing an overview of financial activity.

Persistent Storage: All expense data is securely stored in local storage, ensuring that information remains accessible even after the application is closed.

This project marks my fifteenth undertaking in the "30 Days of 30 Projects" challenge, as part of the Governor IT Initiative program. It showcases my ability to apply React for frontend development, implement state management with hooks, and utilize local storage for data persistence. Through this project, I have honed my skills in building user-friendly interfaces and managing application state effectively.
